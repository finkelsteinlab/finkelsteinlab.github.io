# Abstract

Spectrally resolved infrared stimulated vibrational echo data were obtained for sperm whale
carbonmonoxymyoglobin (MbCO) at 300 K. The measured dephasing dynamics of the CO ligand are in
agreement with dephasing dynamics calculated with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for MbCO with
the residue histidine-64 (His64) having its imidazole  nitrogen protonated (N-H). The two conformational
substate structures B and R observed in the MD simulations are assigned to the spectroscopic A1 and A3
conformational substates of MbCO, respectively, based on the agreement between the experimentally
measured and calculated dephasing dynamics for these substates. In the A1 substate, the N-H proton
and NÎ´ of His64 are approximately equidistant from the CO ligand, while in the A3 substate, the N-H of
His64 is oriented toward the CO, and the NÎ´ is on the surface of the protein. The MD simulations show that
dynamics of His64 represent the major source of vibrational dephasing of the CO ligand in the A3 state on
both femtosecond and picosecond time scales. Dephasing in the A1 state is controlled by His64 on
femtosecond time scales, and by the rest of the protein and the water solvent on longer time scales.
