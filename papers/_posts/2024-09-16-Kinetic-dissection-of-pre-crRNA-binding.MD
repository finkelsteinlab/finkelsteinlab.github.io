# Abstract 
CRISPR-Cas12a binds and processes a single pre-crRNA during maturation, providing a simple tool for genome editing applications. Here, we constructed a kinetic and thermodynamic framework for pre-crRNA processing by Cas12a in vitro, and we measured the contributions of distinct regions of the pre-crRNA to this reaction. We find that the pre-crRNA binds rapidly and extraordinarily tightly to Cas12a (K d = 0.6 pM), such that pre-crRNA binding is fully rate limiting for processing and therefore determines the specificity of Cas12a for different pre-crRNAs. The guide sequence contributes 10-fold to the binding affinity of the pre-crRNA, while deletion of an upstream sequence has no significant effect. After processing, the mature crRNA remains very tightly bound to Cas12a with a comparable affinity. Strikingly, the affinity contribution of the guide region increases to 600-fold after processing, suggesting that additional contacts are formed and may preorder the crRNA for efficient DNA target recognition. Using a direct competition assay, we find that pre-crRNA-binding specificity is robust to changes in the guide sequence, addition of a 3' extension, and secondary structure within the guide region. However, stable secondary structure in the guide region can strongly inhibit DNA targeting, indicating that care should be taken in crRNA design. Together, our results provide a quantitative framework for pre-crRNA binding and processing by Cas12a and suggest strategies for optimizing crRNA design in genome editing applications.
