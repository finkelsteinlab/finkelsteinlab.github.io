# Abstract

Ultrafast spectrally resolved stimulated vibrational echo experiments measure the dephasing of the CO stretching mode of hemoglobin–CO
(Hb–CO) inside living human erythrocytes (red blood cells). A method is presented to overcome the adverse impact
on the vibrational echo signal from the strong light scattering caused by the cells. The results are compared to experiments on Hb–
CO aqueous solutions. It is demonstrated that the dynamics of the protein as sensed by the CO ligand are the same inside the
erythrocytes and in aqueous solution, but differences in the absorption spectra show that the cell affects the protein’s potential
energy surface.
