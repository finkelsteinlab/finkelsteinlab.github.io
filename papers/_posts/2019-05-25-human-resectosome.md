# Abstract

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are a potentially lethal DNA lesions that disrupt both the physical and genetic continuity of the DNA duplex. Homologous recombination (HR) is a universally conserved genome maintenance pathway that initiates via nucleolytic processing of the broken DNA ends (resection). Eukaryotic DNA resection is catalyzed by the resectosome—a multicomponent molecular machine consisting of the nucleases DNA2 or Exonuclease 1 (EXO1), Bloom’s helicase (BLM), the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex, and additional regulatory factors. Here, we describe methods for purification and single-molecule imaging and analysis of EXO1, DNA2, and BLM. We also describe how to adapt resection assays to the high-throughput single-molecule DNA curtain assay. By organizing hundreds of individual molecules on the surface of a microfluidic flowcell, DNA curtains visualize protein complexes with the required spatial and temporal resolution to resolve the molecular choreography during critical DNA-processing reactions.
