# Abstract
Cohesin and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) are key regulatory proteins of three-dimensional (3D) genome organization. Cohesin extrudes DNA loops that are anchored by CTCF in a polar orientation. Here, we present direct evidence that CTCF binding polarity controls cohesin-mediated DNA looping. Using single-molecule imaging of CTCF-cohesin collisions, we demonstrate that a critical N-terminal motif of CTCF blocks cohesin translocation and DNA looping. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of the intact cohesin-CTCF complex reveals that this CTCF motif ahead of zinc-fingers can only reach its binding site on the STAG1 cohesin subunit when the N-terminus of CTCF faces cohesin. Remarkably, a C-terminally oriented CTCF accelerates DNA compaction by cohesin. DNA-bound Cas9 and Cas12a ribonucleoproteins are also polar cohesin barriers, indicating that stalling is intrinsic to cohesin itself, and other proteins can substitute for CTCF in fruit flies and other eukaryotes. Finally, we show that RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) block cohesin-mediated DNA compaction in vitro and are enriched with cohesin subunits in vivo, likely forming TAD boundaries. Our results provide direct evidence that CTCF orientation and R-loops shape the 3D genome by directly regulating cohesin.
