# Abstract

Ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2D-IR) vibrational echo spectroscopy can probe structural dynamics under thermal equilibrium conditions on time scales ranging from femtoseconds to approximately 100 ps and longer. One of the important uses of 2D-IR spectroscopy is to monitor the dynamical evolution of a molecular system by reporting the time dependent frequency fluctuations of an ensemble of vibrational probes. The vibrational frequency-frequency correlation function (FFCF) is the connection between the experimental observables and the microscopic molecular dynamics and is thus the central object of interest in studying dynamics with 2D-IR vibrational echo spectroscopy. A new observable is presented that greatly simplifies the extraction of the FFCF from experimental data. The observable is the inverse of the center line slope (CLS) of the 2D spectrum. The CLS is the inverse of the slope of the line that connects the maxima of the peaks of a series of cuts through the 2D spectrum that are parallel to the frequency axis associated with the first electric field-matter interaction. The CLS varies from a maximum of 1 to 0 as spectral diffusion proceeds. It is shown analytically to second order in time that the CLS is the T(w) (time between pulses 2 and 3) dependent part of the FFCF. The procedure to extract the FFCF from the CLS is described, and it is shown that the T(w) independent homogeneous contribution to the FFCF can also be recovered to yield the full FFCF. The method is demonstrated by extracting FFCFs from families of calculated 2D-IR spectra and the linear absorption spectra produced from known FFCFs. Sources and magnitudes of errors in the procedure are quantified, and it is shown that in most circumstances, they are negligible. It is also demonstrated that the CLS is essentially unaffected by Fourier filtering methods (apodization), which can significantly increase the efficiency of data acquisition and spectral resolution, when the apodization is applied along the axis used for obtaining the CLS and is symmetrical about tau=0. The CLS is also unchanged by finite pulse durations that broaden 2D spectra.
