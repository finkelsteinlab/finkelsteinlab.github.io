# Abstract

Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes are important for many cellular functions but their
prevalence has not been systematically investigated. We developed a proteome-wide
fractionation-mass-spectrometry strategy called differential fractionation (DIF-FRAC) to
discover RNP complexes by their sensitivity to RNase A treatment. Applying this to human cells
reveals a set of 115 highly-stable endogenous RNPs, and a further 1,428 protein complexes
whose subunits associate with RNA, thus indicating over 20% of all complexes are RNPs. We
show RNP complexes either dissociate, change composition, or form stable protein-only
complexes upon RNase A treatment, uncovering the biochemical role of RNA in complex
formation. We combine these data into a resource, rna.MAP (rna.proteincomplexes.org), which
demonstrates that well-studied complexes such as replication factor C (RFC) and centralspindlin
exist as RNP complexes, providing new insight into their cellular functions. We apply our
method to red blood cells and mouse embryonic stem cells to demonstrate its ability to identify
cell-type specific roles for RNP complexes in diverse systems. Thus the methodology has the
potential uncover RNP complexes in different human tissues, disease states and throughout all
domains of life.
