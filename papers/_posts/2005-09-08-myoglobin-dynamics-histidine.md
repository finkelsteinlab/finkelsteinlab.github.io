# Abstract

Ultrafast protein dynamics of the CO adduct of a myoglobin mutant with the polar distal histidine replaced by a nonpolar valine (H64V) have been investigated by spectrally resolved infrared stimulated vibrational echo experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In aqueous solution at room temperature, the vibrational dephasing rate of CO in the mutant is reduced by approximately 50% relative to the native protein. This finding confirms that the dephasing of the CO vibration in the native protein is sensitive to the interaction between the ligand and the distal histidine. The stimulated vibrational echo observable is calculated from MD simulations of H64V within a model in which vibrational dephasing is driven by electrostatic forces. In agreement with experiment, calculated vibrational echoes show slower dephasing for the mutant than for the native protein. However, vibrational echoes calculated for H64V do not show the quantitative agreement with measurements demonstrated previously for the native protein.
