# Abstract
Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there has been international concern about the emergence of virus variants with mutations that increase transmissibility, enhance escape from the human immune response, or otherwise alter biologically important phenotypes. In late 2020, several “variants of concern” emerged globally, including the UK variant (B.1.1.7), South Africa variant (B.1.351), Brazil variants (P.1 and P.2), and two related California “variants of interest” (B.1.429 and B.1.427). These variants are believed to have enhanced transmissibility capacity. For the South Africa and Brazil variants, there is evidence that mutations in spike protein permit it to escape from some vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Based on our extensive genome sequencing program involving 20,453 virus specimens from COVID-19 patients dating from March 2020, we report identification of all important SARS-CoV-2 variants among Houston Methodist Hospital patients residing in the greater metropolitan area. Although these variants are currently at relatively low frequency in the population, they are geographically widespread. Houston is the first city in the United States to have all variants documented by genome sequencing. As vaccine deployment accelerates worldwide, increased genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to understanding the presence and frequency of consequential variants and their patterns and trajectory of dissemination. This information is critical for medical and public health efforts to effectively address and mitigate this global crisis.
