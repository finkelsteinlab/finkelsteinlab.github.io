# Abstract

Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are present in at least 30% of the eukaryotic proteome and are enriched in chromatin-associated
proteins. Using a combination of genetics, biochemistry, and single-molecule biophysics, we characterize how IDRs
regulate the functions of the yeast MutL&#945; (Mlh1-Pms1) mismatch repair (MMR) complex. Shortening or scrambling the IDRs in
both subunits ablates MMR in vivo. Mlh1-Pms1 complexes with shorter IDRs that disrupt MMR retain wild-type DNA binding
affinity but are impaired for diffusion on both naked and nucleosome-coated DNA. Moreover, the IDRs also regulate the ATP
hydrolysis and nuclease activities that are encoded in the structured N- and C-terminal domains of the complex. This combination
of phenotypes underlies the catastrophic MMR defect seen with the mutant MutLa in vivo. More broadly, this work highlights an
unanticipated multi-functional role for IDRs in regulating both facilitated diffusion on chromatin and nucleolytic processing of a
DNA substrate.
