# Abstract
Gene clusters are sets of co-localized, often contiguous genes that together perform specific functions, many of which are relevant to biotechnology. There is a need for software tools that can extract candidate gene clusters from vast amounts of available genomic data. Therefore, we developed Opfi: a modular pipeline for identification of arbitrary gene clusters in assembled genomic or metagenomic sequences. Opfi contains functions for annotation, de-deduplication, and visualization of putative gene clusters. It utilizes a customizable rule-based filtering approach for selection of candidate systems that adhere to user-defined criteria. Opfi is implemented in Python, and is available on the Python Package Index and on Bioconda (Gr√ºning et al., 2018).
