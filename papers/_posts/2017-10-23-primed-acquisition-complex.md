# Abstract

Bacteria and archaea destroy foreign nucleic acids by mounting an RNA-based CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune response. In type I CRISPR-Cas systems, the most frequently found type of CRISPR in bacteria and archaea, foreign DNAs that trigger efficient immunity can also provoke primed acquisition of protospacers into the CRISPR locus. Both interference and primed acquisition require Cascade (CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defense) and the Cas3 helicase/nuclease. Primed acquisition also requires the Cas1-Cas2 integrase; however, the biophysical mechanisms of how interference and primed acquisition are coordinated have remained elusive. Here, we present single-molecule characterization of the type I-E Thermobifida fusca (Tfu) primed acquisition complex (PAC). TfuCascade rapidly samples non-specific DNA for its target via facilitated one-dimensional (1D) diffusion. An evolutionary-conserved positive patch on the Cse1 subunit increases the target recognition efficiency by promoting this 1D diffusion. Cas3 loads at target-bound Cascade and the Cascade/Cas3 complex initiates processive translocation via a looped DNA intermediate. Moving Cascade/Cas3 complexes stall and release the DNA loop at protein roadblocks. Cas1-Cas2 samples DNA transiently via 3D collisions, but stably associates with target-bound Cascade. Cas1-Cas2 also remains associated with translocating Cascade/Cas3, forming the PAC. By directly imaging all key sub-complexes involved in target recognition, interference, and primed acquisition, this work provides a molecular basis for the coordinated steps in CRISPR-based adaptive immunity.
