  quote: "Translating a thing into the analytical language is akin to what the alchemist does when he extracts, from some crude ore, a pure spirit. The gross external forms of things are cast off to reveal the underlying spirit. And when this is done we may learn that some things that are superficially different are, in their real nature, the same."
