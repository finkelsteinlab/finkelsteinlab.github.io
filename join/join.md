The Finkelstein group is an interdisciplinary team of biophysicists seeking to discover how molecular machines maintain and edit our genetic information. We combine molecular biology with micro-/nano- engineering and single-molecule biophysics. We are especially interested in scientists that are at the interface of biophysics, bioinformatics, and molecular biology. However, For specific job openings, see below:

# Postdoc Openings

Applicants with a strong background in bioinformatics, molecular (bio)physics, biomedical engineering, or computer science are strongly encouraged to apply. However, enthusiasm, a strong work ethic and a record of success in your graduate career are the only requirements. Please email Ilya a CV and a cover letter that explains why you are interested in the lab. In your email, please indicate whether you are eligible for postdoc fellowships, such as:

* [NRSA NIH Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-16-307.html)
* [HFSP Postdoctoral Fellowship](http://www.hfsp.org/funding/postdoctoral-fellowships)
* [Helen Hay Whitney Fellowship](http://hhwf.org/research-fellowship/)
* [Damon Runyon Fellowship](https://www.damonrunyon.org/for-scientists/application-guidelines/fellowship)
* [American Cancer Society Fellowship](https://www.cancer.org/research/we-fund-cancer-research/apply-research-grant/grant-types/postdoctoral-fellowships.html)
* [Jane Coffin Childs Fellowship](https://www.jccfund.org/fellowship-information/)

Please note that this is not a comprehensive list.

# Graduate Students

Prospective graduate students with a strong background in molecular biophysics, bioinformatics, or biomedical engineering can join the lab by applying to a number of graduate programs at UT Austin. Possibilities include:

* Chemistry
* Biochemistry
* Cell & Molecular Biology
* Microbiology

# Undergraduate Students

The laboratory strives to include exceptional undergraduates with prior research experience in the life of the lab. To get started in research, please apply to these or related [Freshman Research Initiative](https://cns.utexas.edu/fri) streams:
* [Antibiotics](https://cns.utexas.edu/component/cobalt/item/1423-antibiotics-discovery-and-function?Itemid=1971)
* [Aptamer](https://cns.utexas.edu/component/cobalt/item/1424-aptamer?Itemid=1971)
* [BioBricks](https://cns.utexas.edu/component/cobalt/item/1426-biobricks?Itemid=1971)

Students that are interested in joining the lab are encouraged to [email Ilya](ifinkelstein@cm.utexas.edu) a resume, unofficial transcript, and a short (one-page) **summary of their prior research project**.
