The Finkelstein Lab is an interdisciplinary group of scientists working to combine aspects of molecular biology, micro-/nano- engineering and single-molecule biophysics to understand how the cell maintains genomic integrity. We are especially intersted in scientists that are at the interface of biophysics, bioinformatics, and molecular biology. For specific job openings, see below:

# Postdoc Openings

Applicants with expertise in single-molecule biophysics, molecular biology, or bioinformatics are strongly preferred. Applicants with strong physics or computer science background are also encouraged to apply. However, enthusiasm, a strong work ethic and a record of success in your graduate career are the only requirements. Please email Ilya a CV, three letters of recommendation and explain why you are interested in the lab. In your email, please indicate whether you are eligible for postdoc fellowships, such as:

* NRSA NIH Postdoctoral Fellowship
* HFSP Postdoctoral Fellowship
* Helen Hay Whitney	
* Damon Runyon Fellowship
* American Cancer Society Fellowship
* Jane Coffin Childs Fellowship

Please take a look at other postdoctoral fellowship opportunities.

# Graduate Students

Prospective graduate students with a strong background in molecular biophysics, bioinformatics, or computer science can join the lab by applying to a number of graduate programs at UT Austin. Possibilities include:

* Chemistry
* Biochemistry
* Cell & Molecular Biology
* Microbiology

You are strongly encouraged to apply for a pre-doctoral graduate fellowship. Some options include:

* HHMI International Student Fellowships -- International Students
* NSF Graduate Research Fellowship -- US citizens
* NIH NRSA Pre-doctoral Fellowships -- US citizens

Please look at the fellowship opportunities above carefully and indicate the ones that you would like to apply for. If you've already been accepted to a graduate program, please come by our lab and talk to Ilya about joining the group.

# Undergraduate Students

The laboratory strives to include exceptional undergraduates in the life of the lab. Students that are interested in spending significant time at the bench are encouraged to email Ilya a resume and (unofficial) transcript.
