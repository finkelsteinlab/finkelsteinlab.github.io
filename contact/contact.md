# About the site {#about}
![logo](/assets/images/jenna-luecke-logo.gif "Image courtesy of Jenna Luecke"){:align="right" height="250px"} The site is inspired by the clean and streamlined [Jekyll bootstrap theme](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/), as deployed by the [Drummond](http://drummondlab.org/about.html#contact) and [Bedford](https://bedford.io/) labs. The site is hosted on GitHub pages ([Jekyll+GitHub tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/)), which makes collaborative updates and testing a breeze!  

Our site source code is [freely available](https://github.com/finkelsteinlab/finkelsteinlab.github.io) under an MIT license; fork away! Please include appropriate attribution. I'd like to thank Jim Rybarski for suggesting the move from our prior web framework to Jekyll+GitHub. This upgrade has been immensely pleasurable and long overdue. Nicole Johnson helped to move most of the content.
